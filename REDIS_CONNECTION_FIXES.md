# Redis Connection Pool Fixes

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing 500 Internal Server Error with the following error message:
```
AbstractConnection.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'connection_pool_kwargs'
```

This error was occurring primarily in:
- Spoonacular API integration (`/meal-planning/api/nutrition-profile/connect_spoonacular/`)
- Throttling system
- Django cache operations

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a version incompatibility between Redis Python client (`redis==4.6.0`) and Django's Redis cache backend configuration. The `connection_pool_kwargs` parameter format was deprecated in newer Redis client versions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified Redis Configuration (`wellness_project/settings.py`)
- **Before:**
```python
REDIS_CONNECTION_OPTIONS = {
    "connection_pool_kwargs": {
        "socket_connect_timeout": 5,
        "socket_timeout": 5,
        "retry_on_timeout": True,
        "health_check_interval": 30,
        "max_connections": 10,
    }
}
```

- **After:**
```python
REDIS_CONNECTION_OPTIONS = {}
```

- **Cache Location:** Simplified from `REDIS_URL.rsplit("/", 1)[0] + "/1"` to `REDIS_URL`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in Spoonacular Service (`meal_planning/services/spoonacular_service.py`)

Added try-catch blocks around all cache operations:

- **Rate Limiting Check:**
  - Gracefully handles cache unavailability
  - Continues without rate limiting if Redis is down
  
- **Rate Limit Counter Updates:**
  - Continues operation even if counter updates fail
  
- **Cache Read/Write Operations:**
  - Falls back to no-cache mode if Redis is unavailable
  - Logs warnings but doesn't crash the service

### 3. Improved Throttling Error Handling (`utils/throttling.py`)
- **Before:** Only caught `redis.exceptions.TimeoutError` and `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError`
- **After:** Added `TypeError` to catch the `connection_pool_kwargs` error specifically

```python
except (redis.exceptions.TimeoutError, redis.exceptions.ConnectionError, TypeError) as e:
    logger.warning(f"Redis throttling failed, using fallback: {e}")
    return self._fallback_allow_request(request, view)
```

### 4. Better Error Response in Views (`meal_planning/views.py`)
- Added specific handling for Redis connection errors
- Returns HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) instead of HTTP 500 for Redis issues
- Provides more user-friendly error messages

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Resilience:** Application continues to function even when Redis is unavailable
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Features work with reduced functionality rather than crashing
3. **Better UX:** Users get appropriate error messages instead of generic 500 errors
4. **Monitoring:** Proper logging helps with debugging and monitoring

## Testing the Fixes

1. **With Redis Available:** All features work normally with caching and rate limiting
2. **With Redis Unavailable:** Application works with:
   - In-memory fallback for throttling
   - No caching (direct API calls)
   - Proper error messages

## Compatibility

- **Django:** 5.2
- **Redis Python Client:** 4.6.0
- **Redis Server:** 7.x

These fixes ensure compatibility across different Redis client versions and provide robust fallback mechanisms for production environments.

# Log Errors Fixed - Comprehensive Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Throttling Error: `connection_pool_kwargs` Issue

**Problem:** 
```
Throttling error: AbstractConnection.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'connection_pool_kwargs'
```

**Root Cause:** Redis connection configuration was using nested `connection_pool_kwargs` which is not compatible with the current Redis version.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `wellness_project/settings.py`
- **Change:** Flattened Redis connection options structure
- **Before:**
  ```python
  REDIS_CONNECTION_OPTIONS = {
      "connection_pool_kwargs": {
          "socket_connect_timeout": 5,
          "socket_timeout": 5,
          ...
      }
  }
  ```
- **After:**
  ```python
  REDIS_CONNECTION_OPTIONS = {
      "socket_connect_timeout": 5,
      "socket_timeout": 5,
      "retry_on_timeout": True,
      "health_check_interval": 30,
      "max_connections": 10,
  }
  ```

### 2. Distance Field Validation Error

**Problem:**
```
API Error: {'distance_km': [ErrorDetail(string='Ensure that there are no more than 5 digits in total.', code='max_digits')]}
```

**Root Cause:** The `distance_km` field in the Activity model had `max_digits=5` which was too restrictive for larger distances.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `health_profiles/models.py`
- **Change:** Increased max_digits from 5 to 8
- **Migration:** Created `0004_increase_distance_field_max_digits.py`
- **Before:** `max_digits=5` (max 999.99 km)
- **After:** `max_digits=8` (max 999,999.99 km)

### 3. JWT Token Issues and User Lookup Errors

**Problem:**
```
users.models.User.DoesNotExist: User matching query does not exist.
ERROR 2025-07-24 14:37:04,725 log Internal Server Error: /api/token/refresh/
```

**Root Cause:** JWT tokens were expiring frequently (30 minutes) and refresh tokens were failing due to user lookup issues.

**Fixes Applied:**

#### A. Extended Token Lifetime
- **File:** `wellness_project/settings.py`
- **Change:** Increased access token lifetime from 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Added:** Better token validation settings

#### B. Custom Token Refresh Serializer
- **File:** `users/jwt.py`
- **Added:** `CustomTokenRefreshSerializer` with proper error handling
- **Feature:** Graceful handling of user lookup failures

#### C. Improved Exception Handling
- **File:** `utils/exceptions.py`
- **Added:** Specific handling for JWT token errors and user lookup failures
- **Feature:** Better error messages for authentication issues

### 4. Enhanced Throttling Resilience

**Problem:** Throttling system was failing when Redis was unavailable, blocking legitimate requests.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `utils/throttling.py`
- **Enhancement:** Improved `ResilientThrottleMixin` with better error handling
- **Features:**
  - Fallback to in-memory throttling when Redis fails
  - Graceful degradation instead of blocking users
  - Better initialization error handling
  - More robust connection error catching

### 5. CORS Configuration Improvements

**Problem:** Frontend requests to localhost:8000 were being blocked.

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `wellness_project/settings.py`
- **Status:** Already properly configured with `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True`
- **Note:** The localhost:8000 errors appear to be frontend configuration issues

## Deployment Requirements

### 1. Database Migration
When deploying these fixes, run the following migration:
```bash
python manage.py migrate health_profiles 0004_increase_distance_field_max_digits
```

### 2. No Redis Restart Required
The Redis configuration changes are backwards compatible and don't require a Redis restart.

### 3. No Frontend Changes Required
All fixes are backend-only and maintain API compatibility.

## Monitoring Recommendations

### 1. Key Metrics to Watch
- Token refresh success rate
- Throttling fallback usage
- Distance field validation errors
- Redis connection health

### 2. Log Patterns to Monitor
- `"Throttling error:"` - Should decrease significantly
- `"Token refresh failed"` - Should have better error messages
- `"Redis connection error"` - Should fallback gracefully
- `"max_digits"` errors for distance - Should be eliminated

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health/` - General service health
- `/api/cors-test/` - CORS functionality test

## Expected Impact

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Eliminated throttling errors** - No more `connection_pool_kwargs` issues
2. **Fixed distance validation** - Users can now log longer distances
3. **Reduced authentication errors** - Longer token lifetime and better error handling
4. **Improved service resilience** - Graceful fallbacks when Redis is unavailable

### Long-term Benefits
1. **Better user experience** - Fewer authentication interruptions
2. **Improved monitoring** - Cleaner logs with actionable error messages
3. **Enhanced reliability** - Service continues to function even with Redis issues
4. **Easier debugging** - Better error categorization and logging

## Testing Verification

To verify these fixes are working:

1. **Test distance logging with large values** (>999 km)
2. **Monitor throttling logs** for reduced error frequency
3. **Test token refresh** with expired tokens
4. **Verify service operation** during Redis connectivity issues

## Future Considerations

1. **Redis Connection Pooling:** Consider implementing connection pooling for better Redis performance
2. **Token Strategy:** Monitor token usage patterns and adjust lifetimes as needed
3. **Distance Field:** Consider adding validation ranges based on activity type
4. **Caching Strategy:** Implement more sophisticated caching for meal planning APIs

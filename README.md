## üß† AI Architecture & Strategy

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

Our meal planning system employs a sophisticated **3-step sequential prompting approach** that significantly improves the quality and personalization of generated meal plans compared to single-prompt methods:

#### Step 1: Strategic Analysis & Goal Setting
```
Input: User profile, dietary preferences, health goals, restrictions
Process: Analyze user requirements and create personalized nutrition strategy
Output: Detailed nutritional targets, meal distribution strategy, dietary approach
```

**Why this step matters**: This initial analysis ensures that all subsequent meal generation is aligned with user-specific health goals and constraints. By establishing clear parameters upfront, we avoid generating meals that don't fit the user's lifestyle or nutritional needs.

#### Step 2: Meal Structure & Framework Design
```
Input: Strategy from Step 1, available recipes database, seasonal preferences
Process: Design optimal meal timing, portion sizes, and macro distribution
Output: Structured meal framework with specific calorie and macro targets per meal
```

**Benefits**: This step creates a coherent meal plan structure before selecting specific recipes, ensuring balanced nutrition throughout the day and appropriate meal timing based on user preferences.

#### Step 3: Recipe Selection & Refinement
```
Input: Meal framework from Step 2, RAG-retrieved recipe candidates, user preferences
Process: Select specific recipes and ingredients, validate against restrictions
Output: Complete meal plan with recipes, ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutrition data
```

**RAG Integration**: This step leverages our recipe database through vector similarity search to find the most appropriate recipes that match both the nutritional requirements and user taste preferences.

### AI Model Selection Rationale

#### Primary Model: GPT-4 for Meal Planning
- **Choice Rationale**: GPT-4's superior reasoning capabilities and longer context window enable complex nutritional analysis and multi-step meal planning
- **Temperature Setting**: 0.7 for creative meal combinations while maintaining nutritional accuracy
- **Top-p Setting**: 0.9 to balance variety with relevance in recipe suggestions

#### Secondary Model: GPT-3.5-turbo for Function Calling
- **Use Case**: Nutritional calculations and dietary validation
- **Choice Rationale**: Faster response times for computational tasks while maintaining accuracy
- **Temperature Setting**: 0.3 for consistent, accurate calculations

#### Text-Embedding-Ada-002 for RAG
- **Purpose**: Generate 1536-dimensional embeddings for recipe and ingredient similarity search
- **Choice Rationale**: Optimized for semantic similarity in food and nutrition domain

### Few-Shot Learning Strategy

Our prompts include carefully selected few-shot examples to guide AI behavior:

#### Example Selection Criteria:
1. **Dietary Diversity**: Examples cover various dietary restrictions and preferences
2. **Complexity Range**: From simple snacks to complex multi-course meals
3. **Cultural Variety**: Examples from different cuisines to encourage diversity
4. **Nutritional Balance**: Demonstrate proper macro and micronutrient distribution

#### Sample Few-Shot Example:
```
User: Vegetarian, gluten-free, 1800 calories, high protein
Generated Plan:
- Breakfast: Quinoa porridge with almond butter and berries (450 kcal, 18g protein)
- Lunch: Lentil and vegetable curry with brown rice (520 kcal, 22g protein)
- Dinner: Grilled tempeh with roasted vegetables (480 kcal, 28g protein)
- Snacks: Greek yogurt with nuts (350 kcal, 20g protein)
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Model Decisions

### Recipe Data Structure
Our recipe model includes all required fields for comprehensive meal planning:

```python
class Recipe(models.Model):
    # Required Core Fields
    id = UUIDField()                    # Unique identifier
    title = CharField()                 # Recipe name
    cuisine = CharField()               # Cuisine type
    meal = CharField()                  # Meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack)
    servings = PositiveSmallIntegerField()  # Number of servings
    
    # Ingredients with detailed structure
    ingredients = JSONField()           # Array with id, name, quantity
    summary = TextField()               # Recipe description
    time = PositiveIntegerField()       # Total preparation time in minutes
    difficulty_level = CharField()      # easy/medium/hard
    dietary_tags = ArrayField()         # Dietary restriction tags
    source = CharField()                # Recipe source
    img = URLField()                    # Recipe image URL
    
    # Preparation instructions
    preparation = JSONField()           # Array with step, description, ingredients
    
    # Vector embeddings for RAG
    embedding_vector = ArrayField(FloatField(), size=1536)
```

**Design Rationale**: This structure balances comprehensive recipe information with efficient database operations. The JSON fields provide flexibility for complex ingredient lists and cooking instructions while maintaining queryability.

### Ingredient Data Structure
```python
class Ingredient(models.Model):
    # Required Core Fields
    id = UUIDField()                    # Unique identifier
    label = CharField()                 # Ingredient name
    unit = CharField()                  # Standard unit (grams/ml)
    quantity = FloatField()             # Base quantity
    
    # Nutritional information per 100g
    nutrition = JSONField()             # Object containing:
    # - calories: kcal per 100g
    # - carbs: grams per 100g
    # - protein: grams per 100g
    # - fats: grams per 100g
```

**Standardization Decision**: All measurements are standardized to metric units (grams for solids, milliliters for liquids, kilocalories for energy, minutes for time) to ensure consistency across the platform and simplify calculations.

### Nutritional Tracking Architecture
- **Daily Tracking**: Real-time calculation and storage of daily nutritional intake
- **Weekly/Monthly Trends**: Aggregated data for long-term analysis
- **Goal Comparison**: Automated deficit/surplus calculations with color-coded progress indicators
- **AI Analysis**: Regular summaries with improvement suggestions and achievement recognition

## üöÄ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

### RAG Pipeline Architecture

Our RAG system enhances recipe generation quality through intelligent information retrieval:

```
1. Database ‚Üí 2. Embedding ‚Üí 3. Retrieval ‚Üí 4. Augmentation ‚Üí 5. Generation
```

#### 1. Database Component
- **Recipe Database**: 500+ verified recipes with comprehensive nutritional data
- **Ingredient Database**: 500+ ingredients with detailed nutritional profiles
- **Update Mechanism**: Community-driven feedback system for continuous improvement

#### 2. Embedding Component
- **Model**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- **Vector Dimensions**: 1536-dimensional embeddings
- **Indexing**: Automated embedding generation for new recipes and ingredients
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for efficient similarity search

#### 3. Retrieval Component

2. **Consistency**: Standardized ingredient measurements and cooking techniques
3. **Personalization**: Preference-based retrieval ensures relevant suggestions
4. **Scalability**: Easily expandable database without retraining models
5. **Community-Driven**: User feedback improves database quality over time

## ‚öôÔ∏è Function Calling Implementation

### Nutritional Calculation Functions
All nutritional calculations are performed using AI function calling for accuracy and consistency:

```python
@function_call
def calculate_meal_nutrition(ingredients: List[Dict], servings: int) -> Dict:
    """
    Calculate precise nutritional values for a meal
    
    Args:
        ingredients: List of ingredients with quantities
        servings: Number of servings
    
    Returns:
        Nutritional breakdown per serving
    """
```

### Error Handling Coverage
Our function calling implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Parsing Errors**: Malformed ingredient data validation
- **Missing Parameters**: Default value assignment and user notification
- **Invalid Values**: Range validation and correction suggestions
- **Execution Errors**: Graceful degradation to backup calculation methods
- **Timeout Errors**: Request timeout handling with retry logic
- **Rate Limits**: API rate limiting with exponential backoff

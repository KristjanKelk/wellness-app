# Model Migration Notice

## Important: Model Change from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-3.5-turbo

### Summary
We've updated the AI Assistant to use `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `gpt-4o-mini` to ensure broader compatibility with OpenAI API keys.

### Reason for Change
The error you encountered:
```
OpenAI API error: Error code: 403 - {'error': {'message': 'Project `proj_FbJ5GhqCHZHAuCqOu5ELZoPr` does not have access to model `gpt-4o-mini`', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'model_not_found'}}
```

This indicates that your OpenAI project doesn't have access to the `gpt-4o-mini` model. This is a common issue as `gpt-4o-mini` requires specific access permissions.

### Solution Applied
- Changed the model from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` in `ai_assistant/conversation_manager.py`
- Updated all documentation references

### Benefits
- **Wider Compatibility**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` is available to all OpenAI API users
- **Proven Performance**: Still provides excellent conversational capabilities
- **Cost Effective**: Similar pricing tier to gpt-4o-mini
- **No API Key Changes Required**: Works with your existing OpenAI API key

### Testing Your Setup
Run the included test script to verify your OpenAI connection:
```bash
python test_openai_model.py
```

### If You Have Access to gpt-4o-mini
If your OpenAI project does have access to `gpt-4o-mini` and you prefer to use it, you can change it back:

1. Edit `/workspace/ai_assistant/conversation_manager.py`
2. Change line 27 from:
   ```python
   self.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Using GPT-3.5-turbo for wider availability
   ```
   To:
   ```python
   self.model = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Using GPT-4o mini for efficiency
   ```

### Alternative Models
You can also use other OpenAI models based on your access:
- `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` - Extended context window
- `gpt-4` - More advanced but higher cost
- `gpt-4-turbo-preview` - Latest GPT-4 with improved performance

### Questions?
If you continue to experience issues, please check:
1. Your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
2. Your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Your OpenAI account has the necessary permissions for your chosen model

# AI Assistant Enhancements Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the AI health assistant to better integrate with health data, provide personalized responses, and support advanced features like visualizations and context management.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt with Few-Shot Examples

The system prompt now includes:
- Personalized greetings using the user's name
- Current user context (weight, goals, dietary preferences)
- Few-shot examples for all major conversation types
- Visualization request examples
- Clear boundaries and safety guidelines

**Example interactions added:**
- Health metrics queries (BMI, weight trends)
- Progress tracking (goal proximity, trend analysis)
- Meal plan inquiries (daily meals, specific meal times)
- Recipe information (nutrition, ingredients, instructions)
- Nutritional analysis (daily intake, target comparison)
- Multi-turn conversations with context retention
- Visualization requests with natural language

### 2. Expanded Function Definitions

Added and enhanced functions:

#### New Functions:
- **search_recipes**: Search recipes by query with filters (calories, protein, diet)
- **get_user_preferences**: Retrieve dietary preferences, allergies, and targets
- **generate_visualization**: Create data visualizations for health metrics

#### Enhanced Functions:
- **get_health_metrics**: Now includes activity levels and quarterly data
- **get_progress_report**: Comprehensive reports with weight, wellness, and nutrition
- **get_recipe_info**: Better recipe identification (e.g., "tonight's dinner")

### 3. Improved Context Management

#### Reference Resolution
- Automatically resolves pronouns ("it", "that") based on conversation context
- Tracks discussed metrics, recipes, and time references
- Adds context hints to ambiguous queries

#### Key Information Extraction
- Extracts and tracks:
  - Discussed health metrics
  - Mentioned recipes
  - Time references
  - User goals
  - Recent conversation topics

### 4. Intelligent Conversation Compression

#### Automatic Summarization
- Compresses old messages when conversation exceeds threshold
- Creates intelligent summaries tracking:
  - Topics discussed
  - Health metrics reviewed
  - Recipes explored
  - Progress tracked
- Preserves conversation continuity

### 5. Data Visualization Integration

#### Supported Chart Types:
1. **Weight Trend**: Line chart showing weight changes over time
2. **Protein Comparison**: Bar chart comparing intake vs. target
3. **Macronutrient Breakdown**: Pie chart of daily macros
4. **Calorie Trend**: Line chart of calorie intake over time
5. **Activity Summary**: Bar chart of exercise patterns
6. **Wellness Score**: Multi-line chart of wellness components

#### Natural Language Generation
- AI describes visualizations in natural language
- Provides insights about the data shown
- Suggests relevant observations

## Implementation Details

### Services Enhanced

#### AIAssistantService (`ai_assistant/services.py`)
- Enhanced system prompt generation with user context
- Added new function implementations
- Integrated visualization service
- Improved error handling

#### ConversationManager (`ai_assistant/conversation_manager.py`)
- Added context extraction methods
- Implemented reference resolution
- Enhanced conversation compression
- Improved message handling

#### VisualizationService (`ai_assistant/visualization_service.py`)
- Already implemented chart generation methods
- Integrated with AI function calling
- Supports multiple chart types with Plotly

### Data Access Patterns

The AI assistant now accesses:
- Health metrics (BMI, weight, wellness scores)
- Meal plans and recipes
- Nutrition logs and analysis
- Activity data
- User preferences and targets
- Historical trends

## Usage Examples

### Basic Health Query
```
User: "What's my current BMI?"
AI: "Your current BMI is **24.2**, which falls in the normal range..."
```

### Multi-turn Conversation
```
User: "What's for dinner?"
AI: "Tonight's dinner is **Grilled Salmon with Vegetables**..."
User: "How many calories does it have?"
AI: "The Grilled Salmon with Vegetables contains **380 calories**..."
```

### Visualization Request
```
User: "Show me my weight trend for the last month"
AI: [Generates chart] "This chart shows your weight changes over the past month..."
```

### Progress Tracking
```
User: "How close am I to my weight goal?"
AI: "You're making great progress! Your current weight is **75 kg** and your target is **72 kg**..."
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_ai_assistant_enhanced.py`) is provided that:
- Creates test data (user, health profile, nutrition data)
- Tests all major query types
- Verifies function calling
- Tests context management
- Validates visualization generation
- Checks conversation compression

## Configuration

### User Preferences
- Response mode: concise/detailed
- Max context messages: 10 (default)
- Auto-compress after: 20 messages (default)

### Model Configuration
- Model: GPT-4o-mini
- Temperature: 0.7
- Max tokens: 4096

## Security and Privacy

- Only accesses user's own data
- Clear boundaries on medical advice
- Suggests professional consultation when appropriate
- No cross-user data access

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Voice interaction support
2. Proactive health insights
3. Meal plan generation
4. Integration with wearable devices
5. Advanced goal setting and tracking
6. Personalized recommendations based on patterns

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### "No health profile found"
- Ensure user has created a health profile
- Check database connections

### Visualization errors
- Verify sufficient data exists for the requested period
- Check Plotly installation

### Function calling failures
- Verify OpenAI API key is set
- Check function parameter validation

## API Integration

The enhanced AI assistant integrates with:
- OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language processing
- Django ORM for data access
- Plotly for visualization generation
- Existing health and nutrition models

## Performance Considerations

- Token usage optimized through context windowing
- Efficient database queries with select_related
- Visualization caching for repeated requests
- Compressed conversation storage

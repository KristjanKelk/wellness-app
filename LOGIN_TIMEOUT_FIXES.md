# Login Timeout Fixes

## Problem Summary

The wellness app was experiencing login timeout errors with `ECONNABORTED` messages. These errors were caused by:

1. **Service Hibernation**: The backend service on Render.com goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
2. **Direct Axios Calls**: The authentication service was using direct axios calls instead of the configured HTTP client with hibernation handling
3. **Insufficient Timeout Values**: Default timeouts were too short for service wake-up scenarios
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Timeout errors weren't properly handled or communicated to users

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Authentication Service (`frontend/src/services/auth.service.js`)

**Before**: Used direct `axios` calls without hibernation handling
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
// ...
const response = await axios.post(API_URL + 'token/', { username, password });
```

**After**: Now uses the configured `apiClient` with hibernation handling
```javascript
import apiClient from './http.service';
// ...
const response = await apiClient.post('token/', { username, password });
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic hibernation detection and wake-up
- Proper timeout handling
- Retry mechanisms for authentication requests
- Consistent error handling across all API calls

### 2. Enhanced HTTP Service Configuration (`frontend/src/services/http.service.js`)

**Timeout Improvements**:
- Increased default timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
- Added special timeout retry for authentication requests (120 seconds)
- Enhanced hibernation handling with multiple wake-up attempts

**Authentication-Specific Error Handling**:
- Detects authentication request timeouts
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry with extended timeout for auth requests

### 3. Proactive Service Wake-up in Login

**Service Health Check**: Before attempting login, the service now:
1. Checks if the backend service is healthy
2. Detects hibernation state
3. Automatically wakes up the service if needed
4. Waits for service initialization before proceeding

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Check if service is healthy and wake it if needed
const health = await checkServiceHealth();
if (!health.isHealthy && health.isHibernating) {
  console.log('Service appears to be hibernating, attempting to wake up...');
  await wakeUpService();
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
}
```

### 4. Improved User Experience in Login Component

**Enhanced Error Messages**:
- Specific timeout error detection and messaging
- Network error handling
- Clear instructions for users when service is starting up

**Loading States**:
- "Starting service..." message when waking up hibernating service
- Dynamic loading text based on current operation state

**Retry Functionality**:
- Automatic retry button for timeout errors
- One-click retry without re-entering credentials
- Clear feedback on retry attempts

### 5. Robust Error Handling

**Timeout Detection**:
```javascript
if (error.code === 'ECONNABORTED' || error.message?.includes('timeout')) {
  message.value = 'Login request timed out. The service may be starting up. Please wait a moment and try again.';
  return;
}
```

**Network Error Handling**:
```javascript
if (!error.response) {
  if (error.message?.includes('Network Error')) {
    message.value = 'Unable to connect to the login service. Please check your internet connection and try again.';
  }
}
```

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Service Wake-up Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/serviceWakeup.js`)

- **Health Check**: Verifies service status before operations
- **Wake-up Logic**: Multiple attempts with exponential backoff
- **Hibernation Detection**: Identifies hibernation-specific errors
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Robust retry logic with proper delays

### 2. HTTP Client Interceptors

**Request Interceptor**:
- Automatic token injection
- Request logging and error handling

**Response Interceptor**:
- Hibernation detection and automatic wake-up
- Timeout retry for authentication requests
- Enhanced error logging and user feedback

### 3. Authentication Flow Improvements

**Login Process**:
1. Check service health
2. Wake service if hibernating
3. Wait for service initialization
4. Attempt login with extended timeout
5. Handle errors gracefully with retry options

**Error Recovery**:
- Automatic retry for timeout errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Clear guidance on next steps

## User Benefits

### 1. Reliability
- Login works consistently even when service is hibernating
- Automatic recovery from timeout errors
- Reduced failed login attempts

### 2. User Experience
- Clear feedback during service wake-up
- Helpful error messages with actionable guidance
- One-click retry for failed attempts
- No need to refresh page or re-enter credentials

### 3. Performance
- Proactive service wake-up reduces wait times
- Optimized timeouts for different scenarios
- Efficient retry mechanisms

## Testing

The fixes have been tested for:
- ✅ Fresh service wake-up scenarios
- ✅ Timeout error handling
- ✅ Network error recovery
- ✅ User experience during service hibernation
- ✅ Automatic retry functionality
- ✅ Error message clarity

## Deployment

The updated frontend has been built and deployed to:
- `static/frontend/` directory
- All timeout fixes are now active
- No backend changes required

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to verify the fixes:
- Reduced login timeout errors
- Successful login rates during hibernation periods
- User satisfaction with error handling
- Service wake-up success rates

The login timeout errors should now be resolved, providing a much better user experience even when the backend service is hibernating.

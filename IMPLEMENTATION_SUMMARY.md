### 3. Updated API Endpoints (`meal_planning/views.py`)

#### New Endpoints:
```
POST /meal-planning/api/nutrition-profile/generate_smart_meal_plan/
POST /meal-planning/api/nutrition-profile/analyze_meal_plan/
POST /meal-planning/api/nutrition-profile/connect_spoonacular/
```

#### Enhanced Endpoints:
```

### 4. Dietary Preference Mapping
**Automatic mapping from user preferences to Spoonacular parameters:**

| User Preference | Spoonacular Diet |
|----------------|------------------|
| vegetarian | vegetarian |
| vegan | vegan |
| pescatarian | pescatarian |
| keto | ketogenic |
| paleo | paleo |
| mediterranean | mediterranean |
| low_carb | ketogenic |
| gluten_free | gluten free |
| dairy_free | dairy free |

**Allergy/Intolerance mapping:**

| User Allergy | Spoonacular Intolerance |
|-------------|------------------------|
| nuts | tree nuts |
| peanuts | peanuts |
| dairy | dairy |
| gluten | gluten |
| eggs | eggs |
| fish | fish |
| shellfish | shellfish |
| soy | soy |
| sesame | sesame |

### 5. Cleanup and Optimization
- **Removed redundant services**: Deleted old `ai_meal_planning_service.py` and `enhanced_meal_planning_service.py`
- **Streamlined architecture**: Single service for Spoonacular, single service for AI enhancement
- **Improved error handling**: Better exception handling and user feedback
- **Enhanced caching**: Intelligent caching to reduce API usage

### 6. Documentation

#### Generate Smart Meal Plan
```javascript
POST /meal-planning/api/nutrition-profile/generate_smart_meal_plan/
{
  "days": 7
}
```

# CORS and Redis Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Issues
**Problem**: Frontend at `wellness-app-fronend.onrender.com` was getting CORS errors when accessing backend at `wellness-app-tx2c.onrender.com`

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Set `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = False` for better security
- ✅ Configured specific allowed origins including both typo and correct spellings
- ✅ Added regex patterns for Render.com domains
- ✅ Enabled credentials with `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True`
- ✅ Configured proper headers and methods
- ✅ Set secure cookie settings for cross-origin requests

### 2. Redis Connection Issues
**Problem**: Redis timeouts causing 503 errors and slow response times

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Reduced connection timeouts from 5s to 3s
- ✅ Optimized connection pool size from 10 to 5 connections
- ✅ Increased health check interval from 30s to 60s
- ✅ Added connection pool class kwargs for better handling
- ✅ Reduced cache timeout from 1 hour to 30 minutes

### 3. OpenAI API Issues
**Problem**: `module 'openai' has no attribute 'OpenAI'` errors causing 503 responses

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed OpenAI import to use legacy API format (`openai.ChatCompletion.create`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive fallback handling for AI services
- ✅ Implemented emergency meal plan generation when AI fails
- ✅ Added proper error handling in analytics service
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with older OpenAI package

### 4. Throttling Optimization
**Problem**: Throttling system was failing when Redis was unavailable

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Implemented circuit breaker pattern for Redis failures
- ✅ Added in-memory fallback throttling
- ✅ Reduced throttle rates for better performance (500/min user, 50/min anon)
- ✅ Added graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

#### Settings Configuration (`wellness_project/settings.py`)
```python
# CORS Settings - More secure configuration
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = False  # Changed from True
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
   'https://wellness-app-fronend.onrender.com',  # Typo version
   'https://wellness-app-frontend.onrender.com',  # Correct version
   'https://wellness-app-tx2c.onrender.com',
   # ... other origins
]

# Optimized Redis Configuration
REDIS_CONNECTION_OPTIONS = {
    "socket_connect_timeout": 3,  # Reduced from 5
    "socket_timeout": 3,          # Reduced from 5
    "max_connections": 5,         # Reduced from 10
    "health_check_interval": 60,  # Increased from 30
    "connection_pool_class_kwargs": {
        "max_connections": 5,
        "retry_on_timeout": True,
    },
}

# Optimized Cache Settings
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        "TIMEOUT": 1800,  # Reduced from 3600
        # ... other settings
    }
}

# Balanced Throttling Rates
'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
    'user': '500/minute',   # Reduced from 1000
    'anon': '50/minute',    # Reduced from 100
},
```

#### OpenAI Service Fix (`meal_planning/services/ai_meal_planning_service.py`)
```python
# Fixed import and API calls
try:
    import openai
    HAS_OPENAI = True
    openai.api_key = getattr(settings, 'OPENAI_API_KEY', '')
except ImportError:
    HAS_OPENAI = False
    openai = None

# Fixed API calls to use legacy format
response = self.client.ChatCompletion.create(  # Changed from chat.completions.create
    model=self.model,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1000
)

# Added comprehensive fallback methods
def _generate_fallback_meal_plan(self, user, nutrition_profile, ...):
    """Generate simple meal plan without AI"""
    
def _generate_emergency_meal_plan(self, user, plan_type, ...):
    """Emergency fallback with minimal meal plan"""
```

#### Resilient Throttling (`utils/throttling.py`)
```python
# Added circuit breaker pattern
def allow_request(self, request, view):
    # Check circuit breaker for Redis
    if hasattr(self, '_redis_circuit_open') and self._redis_circuit_open:
        if time.time() - getattr(self, '_redis_circuit_opened_at', 0) < 60:
            return self._fallback_allow_request(request, view)
        else:
            self._redis_circuit_open = False
    
    try:
        # Try Redis first
        # ... redis logic
    except (redis.exceptions.TimeoutError, redis.exceptions.ConnectionError) as e:
        # Open circuit breaker
        self._redis_circuit_open = True
        self._redis_circuit_opened_at = time.time()
        return self._fallback_allow_request(request, view)
```

#### Analytics Service Fix (`analytics/summary_service.py`)
```python
# Fixed OpenAI API call
response = client.ChatCompletion.create(  # Changed from chat.completions.create
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[...],
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### Requirements Update (`requirements.txt`)
```
# Maintained legacy OpenAI version for compatibility
openai>=0.27.0,<1.0.0  # Reverted from >=1.12.0
```

## Expected Improvements

### Performance Enhancements
1. **Faster Response Times**: Reduced Redis timeouts prevent long waits
2. **Better Resource Usage**: Smaller connection pools prevent overload
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Services continue working when Redis is down
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures from Redis issues

### Reliability Improvements
1. **CORS Errors Resolved**: Frontend can properly access backend APIs
2. **AI Service Stability**: Fallback plans ensure meal planning always works
3. **Throttling Resilience**: Rate limiting works even without Redis
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallbacks for all external dependencies

### Security Enhancements
1. **Specific CORS Origins**: No longer allowing all origins
2. **Secure Cookies**: Proper settings for cross-origin authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Balanced rates prevent abuse

## Deployment Verification

### Health Check Commands
```bash
# Test Redis connection
curl https://wellness-app-tx2c.onrender.com/api/health/

# Test meal planning endpoint
curl https://wellness-app-tx2c.onrender.com/api/meal-planning/health/

# Test CORS headers
curl -H "Origin: https://wellness-app-fronend.onrender.com" \
     https://wellness-app-tx2c.onrender.com/api/health/
```

### Expected Responses
- ✅ Health checks should return 200 status
- ✅ CORS headers should be present in responses
- ✅ Meal planning should work with or without OpenAI
- ✅ Redis timeouts should be handled gracefully

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Redis Metrics**: Monitor connection pool usage and timeout rates
2. **Response Times**: Track API response times across endpoints
3. **Error Rates**: Monitor 503/502 error rates
4. **Fallback Usage**: Track when AI fallbacks are triggered
5. **CORS Errors**: Monitor frontend console for CORS issues

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Push changes to Render
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for improvements in error rates
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all functionality works as expected
4. **Consider Upgrades**: If Redis issues persist, consider paid Redis plan
5. **Performance Tuning**: Further optimize based on production metrics

---

**Status**: ✅ All fixes applied and ready for deployment
**Impact**: Should resolve CORS errors, reduce 503 errors, and improve overall performance
**Risk**: Low - all changes include fallbacks and graceful degradation
